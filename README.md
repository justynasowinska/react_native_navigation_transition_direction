# React Native - Change Navigation Direction

This repository illustrates how to change animation direction in React Native for custom screens with [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) library.

Explanation with examples can be found in the blog post (will add link later)

In this repository I'm using Typescript, but in the blog post you will find gists without Typescript added.

### Installation

```
yarn install
cd ios && pod install
```

For Android:

```
yarn android
