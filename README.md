# React Native - Change Navigation Direction

This repository illustrates how to change animation direction in React Native for custom screens with [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) library.

Explanation with examples can be found in the [blog-post] (https://medium.com/@just.sowinska/change-react-native-screen-animation-direction-with-react-navigation-8cec0f66f22)

In this repository I'm using Typescript, but in the blog post you will find gists without Typescript added.

### Installation

```
yarn install
cd ios && pod install
```

### Usage
